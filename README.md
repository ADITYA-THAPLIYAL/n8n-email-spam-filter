# n8n Email Spam Detection & Filtering Workflow

## Description
An automated email spam detection and filtering workflow built with n8n. Integrates Gmail triggers with CleanTalk and Hugging Face APIs to classify, filter, and manage incoming emails using multi-layer AI and external spam checks for enhanced email security and organization.

## Features
- Automated email retrieval via Gmail integration
- Dual spam detection using CleanTalk API and Hugging Face ML models
- Conditional workflow branching based on combined API results
- Multi-stage AI filtering for refined email classification
- Modular and extensible design using n8n's visual workflow editor


## How It Works
1. **Trigger & Retrieval**  
   Starts on new email arrival using Gmail Trigger, fetching email content and metadata.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Custom code node parses and organizes message data for API requests.

3. **Spam Detection**  
   Parallel calls to CleanTalk and Hugging Face APIs analyze emails for spam likelihood. Outcomes are merged.

4. **Conditional Routing**  
   Based on merged results, the workflow either halts or proceeds to further AI filtering.

5. **Advanced Filtering**  
   Additional Hugging Face API calls perform refined classification for detailed email management.

6. **Extensibility**  
   Easily extend this workflow to perform actions like archiving, labeling, or forwarding based on classification.

## Setup
